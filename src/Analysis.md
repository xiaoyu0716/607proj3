# Analysis

How well did you reproduce the original results? What differed?
Evaluate the neutrality of the simulation design:
For Option B (Original Simulation):
Both Options:
Submission Requirements
Suggestions
Simulation Design Tips
Implementation Tips
Paper Selection (Option A)
Good papers to reproduce have:
Were the simulation conditions fair to all methods being compared? Did they ignore important predecessors?
Were there any design choices that favored certain methods?
Were realistic scenarios included, or only idealized conditions?
What would you change about the simulation design? Why?
Did you recreate the visualizations or make your own? What did the visualizations reveal that the original paper missed or undersold?
What was surprising or unexpected in the results?
